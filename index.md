# Hi, I'm Pravallika! 👋

## ML Engineer | RAG Systems & LLM Applications

ML Engineer combining 2+ years enterprise data engineering with hands-on AI/ML development. Built production systems processing 50TB+ data for Fortune 500 clients at PwC, now applying this expertise to modern LLM applications and RAG architectures. Deployed 3 live ML applications (computer vision, NLP, RAG chatbots) using PyTorch, LangChain, and Transformers. 

**Unique strength:** Understanding both messy real-world data AND cutting-edge AI models.

**Currently seeking:** Remote ML engineering role to build scalable AI systems.
